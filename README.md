2. By clicking on the 'Visit Site' button, you will be redirected to product's page of that site.

## Tip:
To avoid 'Product not found', try searching the basic model and then select the desired version of that model instead of searching it with it's specifications.

For Example: Instead of searching 'Apple iPhone X (Space Grey, 256GB)', search 'Apple iPhone X' and then select the desired specifications from suggestions.
